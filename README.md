## Overview

This project is a **Text Encryptor** developed as part of the **ONE Oracle by Alura LATAM** Web Development course. It is a responsive web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The application allows users to encrypt, decrypt, and copy text with ease.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The application adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Encryption & Decryption**: Users can input text to be encrypted or decrypted using simple algorithms.
- **Copy Functionality**: Once the text is processed, it can be copied to the clipboard with a single click.
- **Console Log Alerts**: The application includes alerts in the console to confirm when the text has been successfully copied.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and making it responsive.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the logic behind text encryption, decryption, and copying.
